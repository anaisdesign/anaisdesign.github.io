## Project Overview  
Built a mobile app prototype focused on low-friction habit tracking with motivational streaks and rewards.

## Problem  
Many habit trackers overwhelm new users with complex setup and crowded interfaces. Users want a simpler, more engaging tool to build daily routines.

## Research  
- Interviewed two students about their frustrations with habit trackers, including too much setup and feeling it as a chore.  

## Process  
- Wireframed a simple user flow in Figma:  
  1. Add new habit (short text input)  
  2. Single-tap daily check-in  
  3. Reward screen showing streaks and celebrations  
- Created color-coded, distraction-free UI design with daily reminder mockups.

## Solution  
- Developed a clickable Figma prototype covering core user journey.  
- Incorporated peer feedback to remove forced sign-up and simplify onboarding.

## User Testing  
Peers preferred this over commercial habit apps during mock testing due to simplicity and motivational design.

## Next Steps  
Plan to add push notification reminders and group habit challenges for future iterations.
