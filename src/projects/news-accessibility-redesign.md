## Project Overview  
Redesigned a real news article page focusing on accessibility improvements and better ad integration to enhance user trust and readability.

## Problem  
Many news websites struggle with accessibility: small fonts, poor contrast, and ads that sometimes overlap or obscure text, reducing readability and inclusivity.

## Research  
- Analyzed 5 news articles on CNN and NYT for accessibility issues.  
- Identified pain points: small default text, ad overlays on mobile, and insufficient color contrast.

## Design Goals  
- Increase base font size to meet WCAG guidelines.  
- Improve color contrast for text and buttons.  
- Reposition ads to avoid overlapping text.  
- Add a subtle ad feedback widget at the article bottom.

## Before & After  
- Presented side-by-side “Before” and “After” mockups in Figma.  
- Annotated key accessibility improvements at desktop and mobile breakpoints.

## Accessibility Features  
- Larger fonts with readable line height.  
- Color contrast compliant with WCAG AA.  
- Clear tab order and keyboard navigation considerations (described and simulated).  

## User Testing  
Peer feedback from 3 users confirmed improved readability and reduced distraction.

## Next Steps  
Partner with accessibility consultants for further validation and testing.
